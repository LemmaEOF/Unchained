# Unchained
also known as the Crypto Bullshit Fire Escape

Unchained is the world's first non-crypto, non-currency to be compatible with the ERC-721 specification.

What does that mean?
- No minting fees
- No transactions
- No consensus mechanism
- No blockchain
- No unstable pyramid scheme desperately seeking infinite growth before it immolates the planet
- You can get a hexagon profile picture on Twitter for free I guess

Unchained is designed to be compatible with cryptocurrency wallets like MetaMask **without being a cryptocurrency**,
so that you aren't forced to buy into a manipulative, speculative market to use anything that demands NFTs. This isn't
very helpful within the current landscape, but I've written it as a contingency plan for if some big social network or
such decides that every piece of content you upload has to be minted as an NFT in a fucked-up form of DRM. Hopefully
you will never have to use this.

## Using a Hosted Instance
This will probably vary host-to-host depending on what frontend they use. This is only really a backend.

## Hosting Your Own Instance
I'll write this out once I've actually got it implemented.

## Using This as a Dependency
I'll write this out once I've actually got it implemented.

## TODO
- [ ] Figure out how the fuck the ERC-721 spec works (cryptoloser code is hellish)
- [ ] Hook Unchained up to a database (probably Redis, hopefully I can bundle it in)
